## üöÄ How to Run Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js installed (`v18` or higher)
  * A MongoDB Atlas account and a connection string

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**

      * Navigate to the backend folder:
        ```sh
        cd backend
        ```
      * Install the necessary packages:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
      * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add your MongoDB connection string and a JWT secret:
        ```env
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
        ```
      * Start the backend server:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```

    The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**

      * Open a **new terminal**.
      * Navigate to the `frontend` folder from the root directory:
        ```sh
        cd frontend
        ```
      * The frontend is a static site. The best way to run it is with the **Live Server** extension in VS Code.
      * Right-click the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server".
      * Your browser will open the site, usually at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.
